Attaches (i.e., creates) a new Virtual Machine (VM) to a CloudBench experiment.

At least one VMC is required before VMs can be attached.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached.

Usage: vmattach <cloud name> <role> [vmc pool] [size] [mode] 

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

	<role> are cloud-specific VM configurations, including a default instance
		size and image identifier (e.g., db2, was, apache, windows)
		
	<vmc pool> requests the VM creation on a specific VMC pool. If this particular
		VMC pool does not exist, then VMs will be created either in a VMC from the
		"LG" pool (if their roles have "driver_" or "client_" on their names) or
		in a VMC from the "SUT" pool.

	[pool] allows VMCs to be arbitrarily grouped into pools. Later, Virtual Machines
		/Application Instances can be created/deployed directly into pools, instead
		of individual VMCs.

	[size] cloud-specific instance size (i.e., # of vCPU, vMemory size) name.
		Each vm role has a default size, which will be used in absence of this
		parameter.

	[mode] indicates the execution mode. The default execution mode is synchronous,
		which blocks the command line execution until the operation is completed.
		By adding the keyword "nosync" to the command, a new daemon is spawned, and
		the attachment process occurs in the background.
