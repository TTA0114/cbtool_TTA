Attaches (i.e., registers) a new Virtual Machine Container (VMC), belonging to 
a given Cloud, to a CloudBench experiment.

At least one VMC is required before Virtual Machines and Application Instances 
can be created.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached.

Usage: vmcattach <cloud name> <vmc name> [pool] [mode] 

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

	<vmc name> is a cloud-specific VMC identifier. The identifiers must be listed
		on the cloud configuration file, read by the cldattach command. If the
		special keyword "all" is used, the all VMCs listed on the cloud configuration
		file will be attached in parallel (but still synchronous)

	[pool] allows VMCs to be arbitrarily grouped into pools. Later, Virtual Machines
		/Application Instances can be created/deployed directly into pools, instead
		of individual VMCs. The default pool for newly attached VMCs (without
		any pool specification) is "SUT".
		 
	[mode] indicates the execution mode. The default execution mode is synchronous,
		which blocks the command line execution until the operation is completed.
		By adding the keyword "nosync" to the command, a new daemon is spawned, and
		the attachment process occurs in the background.
