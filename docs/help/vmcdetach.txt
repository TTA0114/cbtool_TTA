Detaches (i.e., unregisters) one or all VMCs (belonging to a Cloud), from
a CloudBench experiment.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached.

Usage: vmcdetach <cloud name> <vmc identifier> [force] [mode]

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

	<vmc identifier> is a cloud-specific VMC identifier. The identifiers must be listed
		on the cloud configuration file, read by the cldattach command. If the
		special keyword "all" is used, then all VMCs currently attached will be 
		detached in parallel (but still synchronous)

	[force] detaches the VMC, even if there are still VMs currently created on it.
		Basically used for CloudBench internal operations.
		 
	[mode] indicates the execution mode. The default execution mode is synchronous,
		which blocks the command line execution until the operation is completed.
		By adding the keyword "nosync" to the command, a new daemon is spawned, and
		the attachment process occurs in the background.

Examples :	
	(Cloudbench) vmcdetach TESTCLOUD test_host1
	 status: VMC B09F0F2B-031E-5240-8B91-34D1E0ACCF80 was successfully unregistered on SimCloud "TESTCLOUD".
	VMC object B09F0F2B-031E-5240-8B91-34D1E0ACCF80 (named "test_host1") was sucessfully detached from this cloudbench experiment.
	(Cloudbench) 
	
	(Cloudbench) vmcdetach TESTCLOUD test_host1 nosync
	Background operation execution success.Operation "vmc-detach" will be processed asynchronously, through the command "/home/cbrtuser/cloudbench/cloudbench_actuator.py --procid=TEST_cbrtuser --osp=port:49014,timeout:70,hostname:9.2.208.60,database:0,protocol:TCP,kind:redis --oop=TESTCLOUD,test_host1 --operation=vmc-detach --cn=TESTCLOUD --uuid=49E616FB-0431-5C36-9326-462EA5FE0678 --daemon". The process id is 18760.
