Detaches (i.e., unregisters) one or all VMs attached to
 a CloudBench experiment.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached.

Usage: vmdetach <cloud name> <vmc identifier> [force] [mode]

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

	<vm identifier> is the CloudBench-specific name of the VM (i.e., "vm_<counter>").
		If the special keyword "all" is used, then all VMs currently attached will
		be removed in parallel detached in parallel (but still synchronous).

	[force] detaches the VMC, even if there are still VMs currently created on it.
		Basically used for CloudBench internal operations.
		 
	[mode] indicates the execution mode. The default execution mode is synchronous,
		which blocks the command line execution until the operation is completed.
		By adding the keyword "nosync" to the command, a new daemon is spawned, and
		the attachment process occurs in the background.

Examples :	
	(Cloudbench) vmdetach TESTCLOUD vm_32
	 status: VM 642C137C-D72F-5E89-8DBA-7E1CBAFB9F21 was successfully destroyed on SimCloud "TESTCLOUD".
	VM object 642C137C-D72F-5E89-8DBA-7E1CBAFB9F21 (named "vm_32") was sucessfully detached from this cloudbench experiment.
	(Cloudbench) 
	
	(Cloudbench) vmdetach TESTCLOUD vm_33 nosync
	Background operation execution success.Operation "vm-detach" will be processed asynchronously, through the command "/home/cbrtuser/cloudbench/cloudbench_actuator.py --procid=TEST_cbrtuser --osp=port:49014,timeout:70,hostname:9.2.208.60,database:0,protocol:TCP,kind:redis --oop=TESTCLOUD,vm_33 --operation=vm-detach --cn=TESTCLOUD --uuid=B4BE1D3E-4602-5710-8A24-B245856ED297 --daemon". The process id is 30669.
